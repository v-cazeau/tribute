            <p class="paragraph"> This website is in tribute to my grandmother Annie E. Cazeau (Michel). Mother of 4 her, full of life. I remember how much fun we would have together as she would let my sister and myself play in her apartment. We took a road trip once and remember being together which is the best memory I could have. She always was warm, loving and her smile would light every space. 
                
            My Grandma loved God and was highly spiritual. She was a very strong woman and her story fails to reach the woman herself. She lives every day within her children and grandchildren baring parts shared with all of us. Love carried and coconut cookies that can be found out of the blue. Never remember the name but always how they looked and felt. To women who lives throughout the ages.</p>

        <h3>Living Influence</h3>
        <p>Her granddaughters, my cousins' names, were influenced by her. My cousin Emiline nicknamed "baby Anne" was inspired after my grandmother's middle name and Sarianna was was a medley of [Sa]brina, [Ri]ck, and Anne.</p>

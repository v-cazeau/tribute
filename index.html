        <h1>Grandma was a G</h1>
    </div>
    <p>This website is in tribute to my grandmother Annie E. Cazeau (Michel). She died when I was 9. Though I was young she has impacted my life and as stories are said about how she loved God, was highly spiritual and loved nature, I find myself more and more like her. Mother of 4 her, full of life. I remember how much fun we would have together as she would let my sister and myself play in her apartment. We took a road trip once and all I remember was us being together which is the best memory I could ever have. She always was so warm, loving and her smile would like up every space. I miss her. She lives every day with her children and grandchildren baring parts shared with all of us. Love carried and coconut cookies that can be found out of nowhere. Never remember the name but always how they looked and felt. To women who lives throughout the ages. Anne E. Cazeau</p>
